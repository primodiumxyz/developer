# About Primodium

![screenshot-1](../public/gameplay/orbit.png)

Primodium is a space-based, empire building MMO game. In Primodium, you mine resources, build military bases, and fight others to gain control over the asteroid belt.

Unlike most games on the market, Primodium is a fully on-chain game. This means that all of Primodium’s game logic and state are executed and stored on the blockchain. The goal for Primodium is to be open and permissionless, meaning any third party developer is free to build on top of it without constraints from EULA or other agreements.

These developer documents are here to help you build on top of Primodium. You’re free to use them to build whatever you think would help give you a competitive edge, enhance coordination between you and other players, or anything else you can think of.
