# Testing Your World Extension

Since the Primodium core contracts are not open source yet (coming soon!), the best way to test your world extension is to fork the Primodium live testnet using
[Foundry](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry).

## Building Upgrade Bounty Example

We will use [Foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/cheatcodes/create-select-fork)'s `vm.createSelectFork()` test function to test that the extension will deploy correctly. Here are the suggested steps to complete building a test by forking the live Primodium testnet:

1. Copy `/examples/building-upgrade-bounty/packages/contracts/.env.example` and paste it in the same directory, while renaming it to `.env`.
2. Change the `PRIMODIUM_RPC_URL` to the appropriate URL. Our current testnet is `https://primodium-sepolia.rpc.caldera.xyz/http`
3. Change the `WORLD_ADDRESS` to the appropriate contract address. Our current Primodium world address is available on the [latest release page](../latest.mdx).
4. Change the `BLOCK_NUMBER` to the your desired block. The current Primodium world was deployed at block number `3007935`, however you may want to use the most recent block given that we may be updating the chain and it will represent the most recent state of the world.
5. If you haven't already, make a new test file in the test folder, like `packages/contracts/test/[YOUR_TEST_FILE_NAME].t.sol`
6. As seen in `/examples/building-upgrade-bounty/packages/contracts/test/UpgradeBountyExtension.t.sol`, use `vm.createSelectFork(vm.envString("PRIMODIUM_RPC_URL"), vm.envUint("BLOCK_NUMBER"));` to fork the chain and run Foundry tests against it.
7. In your test file, make sure to at minimum import the following files. See `/examples/building-upgrade-bounty/packages/contracts/test/UpgradeBountyExtension.t.sol` for more useful imports.

```solidity showLineNumbers copy
import "forge-std/Test.sol";
import { MudTest } from "@latticexyz/world/test/MudTest.t.sol";
```

8. In order to run the tests, make sure you have navigated your terminal to `examples/building-upgrade-bounty/packages/contracts` and then run `forge test`.

Refer to the [Foundry book](https://book.getfoundry.sh/forge/tests?highlight=test#tests) to learn more about building tests.
