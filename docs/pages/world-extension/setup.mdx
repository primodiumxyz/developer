# Setup Your World Extension

Because all Primodium contracts are built and compliant with the open
[MUD standard](https://www.mud.dev) for large-scale Ethereum applications, all
smart contracts that interface directly with the Primodium world contract should
also implement the open MUD standard for a better developer experience.

## Getting Started

To start developing with Primodium, you will need to create a MUD project.

1. Ensure you have
   [`node`](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager#macos),
   [`pnpm`](https://pnpm.io/installation) and
   [`foundry`](https://getfoundry.sh/) installed.
1. Complete the
   [MUD world extension tutorial](https://mud.dev/guides/extending-a-world).
1. Use the following command at the root of your project to initialize your
   extension's MUD version to the same as Primodium's MUD version:

```bash copy
pnpm mud set-version --mudVersion 2.0.9 && pnpm i && pnpm build
```

4. Set the `WORLD_ADDRESS` in your `.env` file and to the live Primodium world
   contract address, available on the [latest release page](../latest.mdx).
5. Set the `worlds.json` file to the following `10017` chainID and substitute in
   the world address:

```json copy
{
  "10017": {
    "address": "PRIMODIUM_WORLD_ADDRESS_HERE"
  }
}
```

7. When you eventually want to test and/or deploy your extension, the namespace
   name for your extension must be unique and not already used within the
   Primodium world contract. To see if your namespace name is available, use the
   tool in this
   [MUD Discord forum post](https://discord.com/channels/865335009915961364/1210703982079639647).
   When you plan on testing, follow the [testing guide](./testing.mdx) so that
   you don't unnecessarily consume a namespace name in the live Primodium world.
   - If you need to change your namespace name, make sure to do so both in your
     `mud.config.ts` file and any function calls that use that namespace name,
     especially in your scripts and tests.
