# World Extension Ideas

The following are world extension ideas to serve as inspiration to deploy
alongside existing Primodium contracts.

Some of the more sophisticated ideas may not be possible with the current state
of the Primodium contracts, but they are included here to serve as inspiration
for future development. Some may
[rely on](./structure/delegation.mdx#revoking-practices) a
`CommittedDelegationModule` MUD standard to be implemented.

### Simple Plugin-like Ideas

- Alliance/agreement entrance fee (using Primodium resources or ETH)
- Enable alliance members to manage your asteroids via delegation
- Simple Asteroid Escrow Post
- Simple Mercenary-for-hire Agreement (using Primodium resources or ETH)
- Simple Bounty Hunting Agreement

### Deep Extensions

- `CommittedDelegationModule` to serve as a new MUD module to help implement
  some of the other ideas
- Alliance resource taxes (and tax collector)
- Other sophisticated alliances
- Local trading posts
- Ajna-style lending and borrowing
- Trade ship insurance
- Escorts for trade ships
- Mercenary-for-hire AMM/marketplace for borrowing fleets
- Mineral rights for asteroids
- Create and enforce borders across the galaxy
- Create a new poker game using existing Primodium resources, with the plugin
  serving as an escrow and systems for transferring resources
  - Casinos (which could result in space pirate raids of the casinos!)

### Complex Game Mods (for when fully open sourced)

- "Space weather" that affects resource accumulation
- "Space weather" that affects battle mechanics
- Create new fleet units with custom assets
