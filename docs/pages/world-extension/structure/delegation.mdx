# Delegation to Extended Systems

**Delegation** can be likened to giving a friend your passcode to access a door.
You are still the owner of the passcode, but you have given it to someone else
to use and act on your behalf.

Delegations in MUD can also optionally be bound to specific time, systems, and
calls as well. These are laid out in MUD's
[StandardDelegationsModule](https://github.com/latticexyz/mud/blob/8193136a9511d066aeebce82155d3509aa760282/packages/world-modules/src/modules/std-delegations/StandardDelegationsModule.sol).

Binding delegations to only the necessary systems, calls, and/or time is a good
practice to follow, as it limits the surface area of a potentially malicious
delegatee.

## Revoking Practices

With delegation, the delegator can revoke access from the delegatee at any
point. If delegation is a part of an agreement with an outside party, the
agreement should be carefully structured such that it is not heavily dependent
on the delegation to remain in the future!

For example, suppose we have two Primodium players named Alice and Bob. Bob and
Alice have an agreement where Bob gives Alice 10 gold today, and Alice delegates
Bob the right to pull 30 gold from Alice a minimum of 3 days from now. Even if
Alice delegated to Bob or a system to manage the agreement, there is nothing
stopping Alice from revoking the delegation before the 3 days pass.

While this is currently a [footgun](../footguns.mdx), but a future release will
include credibly committed delegations that can only be revoked under specific
conditions.
