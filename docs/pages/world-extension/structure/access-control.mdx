# Access Control

**Access control** can be likened to giving a unique passcode to each person who
needs to access a door. You are acting on your own behalf.

Within MUD, there are two different forms of access control worth considering:
[System Access](https://mud.dev/world/systems#access-control) and
[Namespace Access](https://mud.dev/world/namespaces-access-control#access-control-levels).
You should use the prior links to learn more about each. Technically you can add
access to anything with a ResourceId (including tables), but these are not
recommended.

## Namespace Access Control

Namespace Access is a more general and powerful form of access control. It
should be used with caution, as someone given access to a namespace can directly
write to a table within that namespace. They can also access all the private
systems in the namespace, as well as withdraw any ETH in that namespace.

Namespace Owners also have additional rights that should be used with caution.
Review the MUD documentation on
[access control levels](https://mud.dev/world/namespaces-access-control#access-control-levels)
for more information.

## System Access Control

System Access is a more granular form of access control. It allows you to give
access to specific systems that are private and deployed in your namespace. This
is useful for giving access to the functions that modify tables under specific
conditional logic.
