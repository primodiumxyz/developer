# Suggested Extension Patterns

The generic approach that we are suggesting for most cases is:

- Highly restricting namespace access/admin.
- Using system access to gate access to sensitive private systems and their
  functions.
- If user delegation is needed, having users delegate to the systems so that
  systems can only act on their behalf under specified system logic.
  - If a user were to delegate directly to another user, the delegatee is not
    bound by any additional logic.

See the [BuildingUpgradeBounty](../../examples/buildingupgradebounty.mdx)
extension example for an implementation of the following patterns and further
diagrams.

## Private P2P Agreements

### Admin:

1. Complete the
   [necessary steps](../structure.mdx#registering-all-world-extensions) to
   register your namespace, tables, systems, and functions. Make systems
   **default private** unless otherwise necessary.
2. Give system access to agreement partners.
3. Transfer namespace ownership to timelock, multisig, or burn address.

### All members:

1. Necessary people give bounded delegation to the systems that require it
   (don't forget delegation [footguns](../footguns.mdx)).
2. Members execute agreements via system calls.

## Open Public Agreements

### Admin:

1. Complete the
   [necessary steps](../structure.mdx#registering-all-world-extensions) to
   register your namespace, tables, systems, and functions. Make the necessary
   systems **publicly accessible**.
2. Transfer namespace ownership to timelock, multisig, or burn address.

### All members:

1. Necessary people give bounded delegation to the systems that require it
   (don't forget delegation [footguns](../footguns.mdx)).
2. Members execute agreements via system calls.

## Alliances

### Admin:

1. Complete the
   [necessary steps](../structure.mdx#registering-all-world-extensions) to
   register your namespace, tables, systems, and functions.
   - Make systems default private unless otherwise necessary.
   - One system should be an alliance membership system.
2. Transfer namespace ownership to a multisig or alliance management system.

### All members:

1. Members register themselves in the alliance membership system.
2. Necessary people give bounded delegation to the systems that require it
   (don't forget delegation [footguns](../footguns.mdx)).
3. Members execute alliance systems via system calls.

## Opt-in Physics

For example, creating new ships, resources, etc. These patterns are likely not
yet ready due to the lack of [credibly committed delegations](../footguns.mdx).
Let us know if you find a possible use case!
