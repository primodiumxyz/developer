# World Extension Structure

Building on top of the world extension structure as dictated by the open MUD standard, Primodium contracts also includes optional access patterns for various forms of delegation and access control.

## Registering All World Extensions

Before starting to write your own world extension, we recommend you first follow the [setup guide](./setup.mdx). This will give you a good understanding on how the different conceptual components of a world extension below translates directly to its project structure.

1. Register namespace
   - This is where your world extension will live. It is the root of your
     extension and is how access controls and tables are managed. Don't forget
     that the namespace admin has the ability to modify any table or system in the
     namespace, so be careful who you give namespace access to!
2. Register new tables
   - Any additional state not already included in the World should be added
     as a new table. You can also read the tables outside of this namespace,
     but you are still subject to their system constraints for writing to them.
3. Register systems needed in your namespace
   - Any system that you plan on using should be
     registered in to your namespace. Note that if the
     system has already been deployed on the chain and used in another
     namespace, you can use the same system! ([Don't forget](./footguns.mdx) that systems are only
     safe if they are stateless!)
   - Systems can be set as either public or private. Public systems can be called by anyone, while private systems
     can only be called by those with namespace access/admin or those who are given system access.
4. Register functions from your systems
   - Functions are tied to the namespace, so you need to register each function
     so that it is accessible through the World.
