# Deploying your Primodium World Extension

> NOTE: Primodium is no longer available as an official deployment. You can
> deploy your own version of Primodium by following the
> [Source](../overview-source.mdx) page. The following details are kept as
> reference.

Primodium is currently deployed on an
[OP Stack](https://docs.optimism.io/stack/getting-started) testnet hosted by
[Caldera](https://www.caldera.xyz) that resolves to the
[Ethereum Sepolia testnet](https://sepolia.dev/).

## Forewarning

Once you deploy your Primodium world extension to the Primodium testnet, it will
be live and accessible to the public. Additionally, that namespace name will
become taken and no longer available to be used by anyone else (or reregistered
by you). Be sure to [test your extension](./testing.mdx) on the local
development environment before deploying to the live Primodium world.

## Testnet Tokens

Before deploying your Primodium world extension, you will need to bridge ETH
from Sepolia to the Primodium testnet. After obtaining Sepolia ETH from a
faucet, you can bridge to the Primodium testnet using the following
[bridge](https://primodium-sepolia.calderabridge.xyz/).

## Testnet Configuration

To deploy a MUD contract to the Primodium testnet for interoperability with the
testnet Primodium world contract, use the following deployment settings.

```toml copy
[profile.caldera-sepolia]
eth_rpc_url = "https://primodium-sepolia.rpc.caldera.xyz/http"
chain_id = 10017
```

If you haven't already, set the Primodium world address for the following
locations:

1. Set the `WORLD_ADDRESS` in your `.env` file and to the live Primodium world
   contract address.
1. Set the `worlds.json` file to the following "10017" chainID and substitute in
   the world address, available on the [latest release page](../latest.mdx).

```json copy
{
  "10017": {
    "address": "PRIMODIUM_WORLD_ADDRESS_HERE"
  }
}
```
