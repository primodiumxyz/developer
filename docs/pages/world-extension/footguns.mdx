# World Extension Footguns & FAQ

- System names are limited to 16 bytes; anything beyond that will be truncated.
  - If there are multiple systems with the same registered name (due to truncation), your systems may experience divergent behavior.
- Namespace names are limited to 14 bytes; anything beyond that will be truncated.
- Systems should be stateless! If you need to store state, use a table in the namespace.
  If you do not follow this convention, adversaries may be able to exploit your system.
- Delegation in its current form can be revoked by the delegator
  at any time. A future release will include credibly committed delegations that can
  only be revoked under specific conditions.
- System access gives someone the ability to call _any_ function in the system. If this is undesirable, either use proper
  checks in your functions or break apart your system into multiple systems.
- If something in MUD isn't working properly, double check that your MUD version is set to `2.0.0-main-9ef3f9a7`.
  If not, run the following command in the root of your directory:

```bash copy
pnpm mud set-version --version 2.0.0-main-9ef3f9a7 && pnpm i && pnpm build
```

- If you recently changed some configuration, double check that you have run `pnpm i` and `pnpm build` in the root of your directory.
- Any time you have used the `<namespace>__<function>` pattern from a MUD example, replace it with the `<namespace>_<system>_<function>` pattern.
- Namespaces in MUD worlds are unique and exclusive. If you previously registered a namespace to the live Primodium world and attempt to reregister the same name, it will fail. Please be conservative with registering namespaces by using [forked tests](./testing.mdx) of the world until you are confident in registering to the main world.
