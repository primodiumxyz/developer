# Solana DEX Indexer

**A TypeScript indexer for DEX trades on Raydium (Solana) using Yellowstone
GRPC.**

It is best used in conjunction with the [`dex-graphql`](./graphql.mdx) package,
which provides a GraphQL API for querying the data, and the complete infra for
setting up a Timescale database optimized for time-series data, and interacting
with it through Hasura.

_DEX Indexer is available from npm as
[`@primodiumxyz/dex-indexer`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@primodiumxyz/dex-indexer)._

## Introduction

The source code this repository is available on Github
[here](https://github.com/primodiumxyz/dex-indexer-stack/tree/main/packages/indexer).

### Overview

This package is used to index filtered transactions streamed from a Yellowstone
GRPC server—i.e. swaps made on the Raydium AMM program—into a postgres database,
with relevant data being parsed and/or fetched from external sources. The
resulting trades and associated tokens are then available for querying through
the
[dex-graphql](https://github.com/primodiumxyz/dex-indexer-stack/tree/main/packages/gql)
package.

The indexer is designed to be run in a Docker container, but it can also be run
directly in a node environment.

There are a few dependencies on external services:

- [Jupiter](https://station.jup.ag/docs/apis/price-api-v2) for fetching token
  prices (`/prices`)
- [DAS API](https://developers.metaplex.com/das-api) for fetching token metadata
  in the Metaplex standard (`/getAssets`)
- [Yellowstone GRPC](https://github.com/rpcpool/yellowstone-grpc) for streaming
  transactions with low latency

All of these are available from QuickNode through add-ons, which is the
recommended way to run the indexer.

This also requires careful consideration and planning to configure
[batch sizes and batching mode](https://github.com/primodiumxyz/dex-indexer-stack/blob/main/packages/indexer/bin/parseEnv.ts),
due to possible rate limits.

On the database side, the preferred way is to use Timescale, which is optimized
for time-series data, meaning that insertions performance won't be an issue.
Additionally, the
[dex-graphql](https://github.com/primodiumxyz/dex-indexer-stack/tree/main/packages/gql)
package provides functionality that is focused on leveraging Timescale's
capabilities for super-fast queries and subscriptions.

Otherwise, the indexer just needs a postgres interface that will support
inserting many trade entries in the following format (see
[insertTrades](https://github.com/primodiumxyz/dex-indexer-stack/blob/main/packages/indexer/src/lib/utils.ts)):

```typescript
// As a TypeScript type for better readability
type Trade = {
  token_mint: string;
  volume_usd: string;
  token_price_usd: string;
  created_at: Date;
  token_metadata: string;
};

// `token_metadata` being a composite type:
type TokenMetadata = {
  name: string;
  symbol: string;
  description: string;
  image_uri: string;
  external_url: string;
  decimals: string;
  supply: number;
  is_pump_token: boolean;
};
```

### Installation

Just install the package from npm, preferably with pnpm.

```bash
pnpm add @primodiumxyz/dex-indexer
```

### Quickstart

1. Configuration

Add the following environment variables to your `.env` file:

| Variable              | Description             | Default                 |
| --------------------- | ----------------------- | ----------------------- |
| `NODE_ENV`            | Node environment        | `local`                 |
| `HASURA_URL`          | Hasura URL              | `http://localhost:8090` |
| `HASURA_ADMIN_SECRET` | Hasura admin secret     |                         |
| `QUICKNODE_ENDPOINT`  | Quicknode endpoint      |                         |
| `QUICKNODE_TOKEN`     | Quicknode token         |                         |
| `JUPITER_URL`         | Jupiter API URL         |                         |
| `PROCESSING_MODE`     | Processing mode         | `parallel`              |
| `MAX_BATCH_SIZE`      | Maximum batch size      | `100`                   |
| `MIN_BATCH_FREQUENCY` | Minimum batch frequency | `500`                   |

The variables with no default value are required.

2. Run

```sh
local-dex-indexer
# or specify the path to your .env file (install @dotenvx/dotenvx first)
dotenvx run -f ./path/to/.env --quiet -- local-dex-indexer
```

## Usage

### Docker

Usage with Docker is the recommended way to run the indexer, as you can directly
consume
[the image published on the GitHub Container Registry](https://github.com/primodiumxyz/dex-indexer-stack/pkgs/container/sdi-indexer).

You can use the
[`indexer.docker-compose.yaml`](https://github.com/primodiumxyz/dex-indexer-stack/blob/main/resources/indexer.docker-compose.yaml)
file linked in the resources, fill in the environment variables, and run:

```sh
docker compose up
```

This will pull the image from the registry and start the indexer.

To stop the indexer, you can use:

```sh
docker compose down --remove-orphans
```

### TypeScript

Usage with TypeScript is pretty straightforward as well, although it is not the
way it was designed for.

Just import the `start` function from the package and call it:

```typescript
import { start } from "@primodiumxyz/dex-indexer";

const run = async () => {
  await start();
};

run();
```

Don't forget to run it with the environment variables context.

### Development

If you would like to develop on the indexer, you can do so by following these
steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/primodiumxyz/dex-indexer-stack.git
   ```

2. Install the dependencies:

   ```sh
   pnpm i
   ```

3. Run

   a. everything (indexer & database) from root dir with:

   ```sh
   pnpm dev
   ```

   b. only the indexer if the database is already running:

   ```sh
   cd packages/indexer
   pnpm start
   ```

You can also build the package for production at any point:

    ```sh
    cd packages/indexer
    pnpm build
    ```
