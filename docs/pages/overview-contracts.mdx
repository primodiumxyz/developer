# Primodium Contracts

**Primodium contracts** conform to the open [MUD standard](https://mud.dev). The
entry point to all smart contracts is a single
[**world**](https://mud.dev/world/introduction) contract, with logic stored in
[**system**](https://mud.dev/world/systems) contracts and data stored in
[**table**](https://mud.dev/world/tables) contracts. The following pages provide
a high-level overview of the Primodium contracts and their structure.

Primodium contracts are primarily written in
[Solidity](https://soliditylang.org/) and deployable to any environment
compatible with the
[Ethereum virtual machine](https://ethereum.org/developers/docs/evm).
