# Primodium Contracts

**Primodium contracts** conform to the open [MUD standard](https://mud.dev). The
entry point to all smart contracts is a single
[**world**](https://mud.dev/world/introduction) contract, with logic stored in
[**system**](https://mud.dev/world/systems) contracts and data stored in
[**table**](https://mud.dev/world/tables) contracts.

Primodium contracts are primarily written in
[Solidity](https://soliditylang.org/) and deployable to any environment
compatible with the
[Ethereum virtual machine](https://ethereum.org/developers/docs/evm).

## Introduction

All Primodium contracts are available in the
[`/packages/contracts`](https://github.com/primodiumxyz/primodium/tree/main/packages/contracts)
directory in the
[`@primodiumxyz/primodium`](https://github.com/primodiumxyz/primodium/)
monorepo.

### Overview

These contracts are separated into two main directories:
[libraries](https://github.com/primodiumxyz/primodium/tree/main/packages/contracts/src/libraries)
and
[systems](https://github.com/primodiumxyz/primodium/tree/main/packages/contracts/src/systems).
The libraries are used to define core logic that is used across systems, which
are more opinionated and specific to a component of the game.

All of these get "compiled" into a `codegen` directory, which is internally used
for actually updating the game state. The generated `codegen` is available in
the
[@primodiumxyz/contracts](https://github.com/primodiumxyz/contracts/tree/main/src/codegen/)
package and referenced by external smart contracts to interact with the game
state.

The package also includes
[TypeScript utilities for generating terrains, tables and prototypes](https://github.com/primodiumxyz/primodium/tree/main/packages/contracts/ts).

The main entry point for the package is
[mud.config.ts](https://github.com/primodiumxyz/primodium/tree/main/packages/contracts/mud.config.ts),
which houses the tables and world inputs, and it also exports
[various constants, enums and prototype configurations](https://github.com/primodiumxyz/primodium/tree/main/packages/contracts/config)
for usage from other packages.

The actual configuration—applying the initial
[prototype configuration](https://github.com/primodiumxyz/primodium/tree/main/packages/contracts/config/prototypeConfig.ts)
to the game state—is done in the
[PostDeploy](https://github.com/primodiumxyz/primodium/tree/main/packages/contracts/script/PostDeploy.s.sol)
script, ran after the contracts are deployed.

### Installation

Follow the [README](./overview-source.mdx) in the root of the monorepo to
install the necessary dependencies and configure the environment.

This package needs its own `.env` file for specifying the deployer's private
key:

```bash
# From this directory:
# The default anvil private key
echo "PRIVATE_KEY=0xac0974bec39a17e36ba4a6b4d238ff944bacb478cbed5efcae784d7bf4f2ff80" >> .env
```

```

## Development

### Building

To build the contracts, run:

```bash
pnpm build
```

This will run the following commands sequentially:

```bash
pnpm run build:lib # Generates source contracts in codegen and terrain
pnpm run build:mud # Generates prototypes and compiles contracts
pnpm run build:abi-ts # Generates TypeScript bindings for the contracts
```

### Testing

To test the contracts, run:

```bash
pnpm test
```

This will build the contracts and run the tests with MUD.

If you want to test a specific contract and skip build, you can run:

```bash
pnpm mud test --skipBuild --forgeOptions='--mc <contract_name>'
```

## Usage

Generally, you should refer directly to the
[MUD documentation](https://mud.dev/introduction) for more information on how to
modify the MUD config, add systems, etc.

If you would like to add an extension to the game, you can directly refer to the
[dedicated package in this monorepo](https://github.com/primodiumxyz/primodium/tree/main/examples/template).

You can directly add a system or library in their respective directories, and
they will be included in the codegen in the next build.

For tables, you can directly add them in the
[`mud.config.ts`](https://github.com/primodiumxyz/primodium/tree/main/packages/contracts/mud.config.ts)
file with their schema, and they will be available in the client with TypeScript
bindings.

If this is a prototype table (`P_<table_name>`), you can add a prototype
configuration (or settings) in the
[`prototypeConfig.ts`](https://github.com/primodiumxyz/primodium/tree/main/packages/contracts/config/prototypeConfig.ts)
file, and it will be applied to the game state when the contracts are deployed.

A note during development; the `DevSystem` will expose direct table access.
Meaning that you can directly modify the state for any table at a low level from
the client. For instance:

```typescript
// To set some data on a table:
DevSystem.devSetRecord(tableId, key, data, valueSchema);
// To remove a record:
DevSystem.devDeleteRecord(tableId, key, valueSchema);
```

## Deployment

For deployment instructions, see the
[README](https://github.com/primodiumxyz/primodium/tree/main/README.md#deployment)
in the root of the monorepo.
