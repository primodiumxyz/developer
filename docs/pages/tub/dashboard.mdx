# Solana DEX dashboard

![dashboard](../../public/tub/dashboard.svg)

A React dashboard for visualizing the data indexed in the
[`GraphQL`](https://github.com/primodiumxyz/tub-ios/blob/main/packages/gql/README.md)
database. It uses [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) for styling and
[TradingView](https://www.tradingview.com/) for the line and candles charts.

The purpose of this dashboard is to visualize conveniently top-ranked tokens
that will show up in the iOS app, with their line & candles charts, as well as
user analytics to understand the user behavior.
