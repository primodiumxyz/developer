## Namespace

The latest match of Primodium is being played in the `Pri_11` namespace. When calling core game functions for the latest match, you must prepend the function call with the namespace. For example, to call the `getAsteroid` function in the `Asteroid` table, you would call `Pri_11__getAsteroid`. The ABI should already have the namespace prepended to the function name.

## Source

Publicly-available source code is available on the [Primodium GitHub](https://github.com/primodiumxyz/developer/tree/main@primodiumxyz/contracts) and detailed in the [source guide](./overview-source.mdx). The compiled source and ABIs are available on the [block explorer](https://primodium-sepolia.explorer.caldera.xyz/address/0x060f3f0915999fa84886f6e993cd95c4b2046b43?tab=contract).

## Changelog

v0.11.0 is our biggest update to date. We've changed and added the following:

- Alliance leaderboard scoring changed to reflect two playstyles: economy and conquest.
  - Economy: Increase your score by sacrificing resources to a wormhole.
  - Conquest: Increase your score by conquering key asteroids and volatile shards.
- Wormholes demand a specific resource type to be sacrificed in order to receive points, but the resource type changes over time.
- Volatile shards are proto-asteroids that can be conquered and held for large conquest points. They are volatile and can be explode after a period of time, but will respawn elsewhere.
- Victory conditions: the match ends when the unit destruction counter is filled. The alliance with the highest score wins.
- Colony slots limit how many colonies + colony ships you can possess at one time. Each purchased slot gets increasingly more expensive.
- Colony ship production costs are now fixed.
- You can now opt to abandon an asteroid in order to free a colony slot.
- Building levels have been expanded, including the main base, which now has 15 levels.
- Expanded objectives to instruct and guide players as they progress.
- New and improved UI for fleet command, transfer, and management.
