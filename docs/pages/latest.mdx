contract at the above address, referred in the following docs as the _world

The [contracts overview guide](./overview-contracts.mdx) describes Primodium
contract structure and interactions.

## Namespace

The latest match of Primodium is being played in the `Pri_11` namespace. When
calling core game functions for the latest match, you must prepend the function
call with the namespace. For example, to call the `getAsteroid` function in the
`Asteroid` table, you would call `Pri_11__getAsteroid`. The ABI should already
have the namespace prepended to the function name.

## Source

Publicly-available source code, including compiled source and ABIs, is available
on the [Primodium GitHub](https://github.com/primodiumxyz/contracts/) and
detailed in the [source guide](./overview-source.mdx).

## Changelog

v0.11 is our biggest update to date. We've changed and added the following:

- New leaderboard scoring format to highlight two core gameplay loops: conquest
  and economy.
  - Primodium: Capture asteroids and volatile shards to claim Primodium, which
    increases your conquest points.
  - Wormhole: Sacrifice specific resources into a wormhole to increase your
    economy points.
- Volatile shards are proto-asteroids that can be captured to quickly claim
  Primodium.
  - Be careful! They are known to explode after existing for a certain amount of
    time and destroy all units in orbit or traveling to/from it.
  - An exploded shard will respawn in a new location.
- Wormholes demand specific resources to be sacrificed at different times, and
  randomly rotates between the different resources.
- The match now ends when the unit death counter has reached its limit!
- Colony Slots are introduced to the game. They are occupied by each owned
  asteroid and Colony Ship.
- Colony Ships now have a fixed training cost, but require a free Colony Slot.
- You can now abandon an asteroid in order to free up a Colony Slot.
- Asteroids with basic resources now generate resources and droid defenses over
  time. They can be raided for extra resources!
- Only one starmapper can be built on an asteroid at a time.
- Improved objectives to guide players through the game.
- Increased building level maximums across much of the different types. Main
  bases can now be upgraded to level 15!
- New Command Center interface to help manage your empire.
