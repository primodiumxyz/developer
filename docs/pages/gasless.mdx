# Primodium Gasless

**Primodium Gasless** is a server library for creating a gasless server with
[MUD-compliant](https://github.com/latticexyz/mud) Ethereum smart contracts.

This library is available from npm with the package name
[`@primodiumxyz/gasless-server`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@primodiumxyz/gasless-server).
It is also available as a Docker container on the
[Github Container Registry](https://github.com/primodiumxyz/gasless-server/pkgs/container/gasless-server)
so you can run it straight away in a container.

## Introduction

The source code for this monorepo is available on Github
[here](https://github.com/primodiumxyz/gasless). The monorepo contains the
server library and a test contracts package for verifying the server's
functionality.

### Overview

This gasless server allows users to set up delegation within MUD systems for the
paymaster/server wallet to make system calls on their behalf, without requiring
them to pay gas.

Additionally, the server exposes endpoints to directly send signed transactions
to the server, which will be broadcasted on the user's behalf. The main benefit
here is that it allows native tokens to be passed from the user's wallet to some
recipient or contract, which is not possible within the MUD system.

It provides types for both node and browser environments.

The smart contract toolkit in this repository is based on
[Foundry](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry) and
[Anvil](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/tree/master/crates/anvil) as the
local Ethereum development node.

### Installation

Just install the package from npm, preferably with pnpm.

```bash
pnpm add @primodiumxyz/gasless-server
```

### Quickstart

1. Configuration

Add the following environment variables to your `.env` file:

| Variable                        | Description                              | Default                                                              |
| ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `GASLESS_SERVER_PRIVATE_KEY`    | Private key to use for the server wallet | `0xac0974bec39a17e36ba4a6b4d238ff944bacb478cbed5efcae784d7bf4f2ff80` |
| `GASLESS_SERVER_CHAIN`          | Chain to use (any viem chain)            | `foundry`                                                            |
| `GASLESS_SERVER_PORT`           | Port to run the server on                | `3000`                                                               |
| `GASLESS_SERVER_SESSION_SECRET` | Fastify session secret                   | `pqu3QS3OUB9tIiWntAEI7PkaIfp2H73Me2Lqq340FXc2`                       |

2. Run

```sh
local-gasless-server
# or specify the path to your .env file (install @dotenvx/dotenvx first)
dotenvx run -f ./path/to/.env --quiet -- local-gasless-server
```

## Usage

### Docker

Usage with Docker is the recommended way to run the server, as you can directly
consume
[the image published on the GitHub Container Registry](https://github.com/primodiumxyz/gasless-server/pkgs/container/gasless-server).

You can use the [`server.docker-compose.yaml`](./server.docker-compose.yaml)
file provided for reference, fill in the environment variables, and run:

```sh
docker compose up
```

This will pull the image from the registry and start the server.

To stop the server, you can use:

```sh
docker compose down --remove-orphans
```

### TypeScript

The tests provide a good overview of how to
[register/unregister delegations](./__tests__/routes/session.test.ts) and then
[make calls](./__tests__/routes/call.test.ts) with the server, or how to
directly [send signed transactions](./__tests__/routes/signedCall.test.ts).

For instance, you can register a delegation with:

```typescript
// Import from @primodiumxyz/gasless-server/react if you're using React
import {
  SERVER_WALLET,
  TIMEBOUND_DELEGATION,
  UNLIMITED_DELEGATION,
  type BadResponse,
  type RouteResponse,
} from "@primodiumxyz/gasless-server";

// Create the calldata for registering a delegation
const delegateCallData = encodeFunctionData({
  abi: WorldAbi,
  functionName: "registerDelegation",
  args: [
    SERVER_WALLET.account.address, // the paymaster wallet instance created from env.GASLESS_SERVER_PRIVATE_KEY we want to delegate to
    sessionLength ? TIMEBOUND_DELEGATION : UNLIMITED_DELEGATION, // the type of delegation we want to set
    sessionLength
      ? encodeFunctionData({
          abi: Abi,
          functionName: "initDelegation",
          args: [
            SERVER_WALLET.account.address,
            BigInt(Math.floor(Date.now() / 1000) + sessionLength),
          ], // delegate for some provided `sessionLength` seconds
        })
      : "0x", // if we're setting an unlimited delegation, we don't need to provide any init call data
  ],
});

// Sign the call data somehow (see __tests__/lib/sign.ts for an example)
const signature = await signCall({
  userClient: user,
  worldAddress: worldAddress,
  systemId: getSystemId("Registration"),
  callData: delegateCallData,
  nonce: await fetchSignatureNonce(userAddress), // see __tests__/lib/fetch.ts for an example
});

// Send the request to the server
const response = await fetch(`${serverUrl}/session`, {
  method: "POST",
  headers: {
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    address: userAddress,
    worldAddress: worldAddress,
    params: [getSystemId("Registration"), delegateCallData, signature],
  }),
  credentials: "include",
});

// Handle the response
// You can create an agent to automatically map the response to the correct type depending on the request
// See __tests__/lib/agent.ts for an example
const data = (await response.json()) as
  | RouteResponse<"/session", "POST">
  | BadResponse;
console.log(data);
// -> { authenticated: true, txHash: '0x...' }
```

For more examples, see the [tests](./__tests__) directly;
[submitting a call after delegating](./__tests__/lib/calls.ts),
[sending a signed transaction with or without native tokens](./__tests__/lib/signedCall.ts).

## Development

### Running the server

```bash
pnpm dev:server # from root
pnpm dev # from packages/server, with watch mode
pnpm start # from packages/server, with production mode (no watch)
```

The server will start on the port specified in the `.env` file.

### Testing and building

To run tests, first deploy the test contracts from the root directory:

```bash
# Add the Anvil private key to `packages/test-contracts/.env`
echo "PRIVATE_KEY=0xac0974bec39a17e36ba4a6b4d238ff944bacb478cbed5efcae784d7bf4f2ff80" > packages/test-contracts/.env

# Run the Anvil development node and deploy contracts
pnpm run dev
```

Then run tests in a separate terminal session:

```bash
pnpm test
# or
pnpm test:watch
# or
pnpm test:ui
```

To build the server package, run:

```bash
pnpm build
```

## Additional context

### Limitations

There are some limitations to this server due to the intrinsic design of MUD.
The specific issue is that **a wallet cannot authorize a transaction with a
native token transfer to be made on its behalf**.

### Details

The way MUD works is that the EOA of the delegator (the user) authorizes a
delegate's EOA (the centralized wallet in the gasless server) to make system
calls on its behalf—as in calls within the MUD system—but there is no way for an
EOA to authorize another EOA to perform unlimited native token transfers on its
behalf. Therefore, appending a native token transfer to a MUD call through
delegation is technically possible, but it would transfer the funds out of the
delegate's EOA, which is not what we want.

This design would however work for any app that doesn't require native token
transfers; i.e., a game that solely performs calls within the MUD system,
without any payment of native tokens.

### Mitigation

One mitigation is to have the delegator sign the transaction, and send it to the
server in order for the delegate to broadcast it, and effectively pay for the
gas. This way, we're not using the MUD delegation system but rather some native
EVM gas sponsorship. However, the user/delegator has to sign every single call,
so even though this solution does enable gas sponsorship, it doesn't solve the
UX problem of removing systematic interaction with the wallet for every single
transaction to be made.

The above design is integrated into the gasless server under the `signedCall`
route, and doesn't require initializing a MUD delegation (as it doesn't use it
at all).

### Potential solutions

There are a few solutions that could be implemented to enable true gasless and
signless transactions. For instance:

1. Using an ERC20 token (e.g. WETH) instead of native tokens, and pre-approving
   the delegate to transfer a large enough amount of that token on behalf of the
   delegator.
2. Prompting the delegator to deposit native tokens into the delegate's wallet
   through a contract, and tracking their balance
   (`deposited amount - amount spent on their behalf`) on every call. This would
   revert if the user doesn't have enough "allowance" (balance). This would use
   the standard MUD delegation design, which is that native tokens are
   transferred from the _delegate wallet_, while we take care of
   depositing/tracking balances ourselves.
3. Creating a smart account for the user, which would be able to delegate
   transfers of native tokens to another wallet as part of its design. This
   would require the user to deposit some funds into the smart account, so it's
   a bit similar to the previous solution in terms of UX.
