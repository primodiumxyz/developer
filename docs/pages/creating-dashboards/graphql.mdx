## Primodium GraphQL
Endpoint:
```
https://graphql.primodium.ai/v1/graphql
```

We have added a graphql endpoint for easy querying of our indexer data built on top of Hasura.

## Getting started

This section assumes knowledge of graphql and its related technologies.

It is recommended to use a graphql playground to introspect the schema and get understanding of our data model and look at the [hasura docs for further info on advance querying](https://hasura.io/docs/latest/queries/postgres/index/):

> NOTE: Currently, tables and its fields are exposed; however, full data type support and relations are missing due to the nature of how are decoded data is stored.

- [Apollo Studio](https://studio.apollographql.com/sandbox/explorer)
- [GraphiQL Online](https://lucasconstantino.github.io/graphiql-online/)

For this quide, we will use *Apollo Studio*:

1. Go to [Apollo Studio](https://studio.apollographql.com/sandbox/explorer)
2. Set the sandbox url to our endpoint `https://graphql.primodium.ai/v1/graphql`

3. Query away!


## Query Decoded Data

For this example we will query the top 10 scores of the current round:
```gql
query Top10Score {
  viewScore(limit: 10, orderBy: { value: DESC}) {
    entity
    value
  }
}
```

## Query Encoded Data

For this example we will query mud records between a block range:
```gql
query MudRecords($where: MudRecordsBoolExp = {
  blockNumber: {
       _lte: 4824475,
      _gte: 4823475
    }
}, $limit: Int = 1000) {
  mudRecords(where: $where, limit: $limit) {
    address
    blockNumber
    dynamicData
    encodedLengths
    isDeleted
    key0
    key1
    keyBytes
    logIndex
    staticData
    tableId
  }
}
```
