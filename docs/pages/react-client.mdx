# Primodium Client Templates

Use the
[Primodium Client Template](https://github.com/primodiumxyz/create-primodium) to
get started with creating Primodium clients with the
[Primodium Core](./core-library.mdx) TypeScript API.

## Getting Started

> **Compatibility Note:** Primodium requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
> version 18+, 20+. However, some templates require a higher Node.js version to
> work. Please upgrade if your package manager warns about it.

With `npm`:

```bash copy
npm create primodium@latest
```

With `yarn`:

```bash copy
yarn create primodium
```

With `pnpm`:

```bash copy
pnpm create primodium
```

With `bun`:

```bash copy
bun create primodium
```

Then follow the prompts!

You can also directly specify the project name and the template you want to use
via additional command line options:

```bash copy
# npm 7+, extra double-dash is needed:
npm create primodium@latest my-primodium-app --template react-client

# yarn
yarn create primodium my-primodium-app --template react-client

# pnpm
pnpm create primodium my-primodium-app --template react-client

# Bun
bun create primodium my-primodium-app --template react-client
```

Currently supported template presets include:

- `react-client`
- `react-client-lite`

You can use `.` for the project name to scaffold in the current directory.
