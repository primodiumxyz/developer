# Deploying the World Extension

We can use the same command and script we used for the simulation, but append `--broadcast`.

When you are certain you are ready to deploy, you can use this command. This will cost ETH on `caldera-sepolia`.

```bash copy 
forge script script/RegisterWriteDemoSystem.s.sol --fork-url https://primodium-sepolia.rpc.caldera.xyz/http --broadcast
```

Refer to the ReadDemo [deploy guide](../readdemo/deploy.mdx) for more details.
