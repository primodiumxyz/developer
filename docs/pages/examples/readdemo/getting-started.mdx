# Getting Started (Walkthrough)

## MUD Versions

This tutorial was built against MUD version `2.0.9`. If needed, the command to
update to the latest MUD version is:

```bash copy
pnpm mud set-version --mudVersion 2.0.9 && pnpm i && pnpm build
```

The world address for the extension developer testnet v0.11.x is
`0x1b541ec9cbe3ef02461c50d0b52a486d19f34c15`.

The `WORLD_ADDRESS` and `BLOCK_NUMBER` are pre-configured in the `.env.example`.
You should copy this to `.env`, and make any desired changes there. Note that
this guide was written before the world was deployed, so the `BLOCK_NUMBER` will
need to be updated.

The `.gitignore` is already configured to not upload your `.env`, but it is
always good practice to confirm the ignores in your `.gitignore` for yourself.
Anything pushed to Git lives there forever and can be retrieved by anyone even
if you delete it in later commits. Check twice (maybe 3 times), push once. NEVER
push live private keys or .env files to Git.
