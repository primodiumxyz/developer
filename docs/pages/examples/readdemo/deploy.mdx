# Deploying the World Extension

Now it's time to write something to the chain.  We can use the same command and script we used for the simulation, but append `--broadcast`.

When you are CERTAIN you are ready to deploy, you can use this command:

```bash
forge script script/RegisterReadDemoSystem.s.sol --fork-url https://primodium-sepolia.rpc.caldera.xyz/http --broadcast
```

This will cost ETH on caldera-sepolia.
