# Deploying the World Extension

Now it's time to write something to the chain.

Before deploying your Primodium world extension, you will need to bridge ETH
from Sepolia to the Primodium testnet. After obtaining Sepolia ETH from a
faucet, you can bridge to the Primodium testnet using the following
[bridge](https://primodium-sepolia.calderabridge.xyz/).

Note that the caldera-sepolia network has the following configuration.

```toml copy
[profile.caldera-sepolia]
eth_rpc_url = "https://primodium-sepolia.rpc.caldera.xyz/http"
chain_id = 10017
```

To deploy the world extension, We can use the same command and script we used
for the simulation, but append `--broadcast` to broadcast the transaction.

```bash copy
forge script script/RegisterReadDemoSystem.s.sol --fork-url https://primodium-sepolia.rpc.caldera.xyz/http --broadcast
```
