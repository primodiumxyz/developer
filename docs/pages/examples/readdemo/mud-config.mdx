# Create Extension Tables

[**Primodium Tables**](../../overview-contracts/tables.mdx) store data in and are based on [on-chain tables](https://mud.dev/templates/typescript/contracts#tables) as defined in the open MUD standard.

Primodium Tables exist both in the core Primodium contracts and in world extensions. When defining a new table, you must first declare it in the `mud.config.ts` file. This file is used to generate the Solidity contracts that handle setters, getters, and decoding of each table.

In the ReadDemo, the code can be found in `packages/contracts/mud.config.ts`. Every plugin will need a mudConfig, which is stored in `mud.config.ts`. Plugins must exist in a `Namespace`. Multiple `Systems` can exist in a namespace.

Since this demo only deploys a system for reading data, we will not need any new `Tables`, but we will need to declare a `Namespace` and `System`.

```ts filename="mud.config.ts"
import { defineWorld } from "@latticexyz/world";

export default defineWorld({
  namespace: "PluginExamples",
  systems: {
    ReadDemoSystem: {
      name: "ReadDemoSystem",
      openAccess: true,
    },
  },
  tables: {},
});
```

The `Namespace` is where the `System` will live. They can be up to 16 characters long, and every namespace must be unique. If you run into a collision, choose a different name. The revert should say something like `World_ResourceAlreadyExists()` if there is a namespace collision.
