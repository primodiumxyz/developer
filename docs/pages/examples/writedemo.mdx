# Write Demo
https://github.com/primodiumxyz/developer/tree/main/examples/WriteDemo

This demo introduces you to a variety of Primodium-specific tables and systems.

There are detailed line-by-line comments in the source code.

We will find an open resource tile on your main base, and call the Primodium `BuildSystem` to build an Iron Mine on it. We will touch on resource enumerations, prototypes, blueprints, and other Primodium game structures. You'll also interact with delegations. You'll be reading heavily from game `Table`s, and working with various game Types.
