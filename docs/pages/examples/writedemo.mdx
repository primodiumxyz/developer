# Primodium WriteDemo

The **Primodium WriteDemo** introduces you to a variety of Primodium-specific
tables and systems by writing data to a Primodium table with a world extension.
This demo finds an open resource tile on your main base, and call the Primodium
`BuildSystem` to build an Iron Mine on it. We will touch on resource
enumerations, prototypes, blueprints, and other Primodium game structures.

The source code for the Demo is available on Github
[here](https://github.com/primodiumxyz/developer/tree/main/examples/WriteDemo).
