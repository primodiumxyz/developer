# Primodium Indexer

The **Primodium Indexer** is an off-chain indexer implementation compliant with the open [MUD standard](https://mud.dev/). It comprises two separate `npm` packages with [source](https://github.com/primodiumxyz/mud-state-tools) released under the MIT License.

- [`@primodiumxyz/pg-indexer-read`](https://github.com/primodiumxyz/mud-state-tools/blob/main/packages/pg-indexer-reader/README.md): replaces the `postgres-frontend` in the Lattice [store-indexer](https://github.com/latticexyz/mud/tree/main/packages/store-indexer) implementation.
- [`@primodiumxyz/sync-stack`](https://github.com/primodiumxyz/mud-state-tools/blob/main/packages/sync-stack/README.md): replaces `syncToRecs()` in the Lattice [store-sync](https://github.com/latticexyz/mud/tree/main/packages/store-sync) TypeScript client.

## Overview

All game state Primodium is stored fully on-chain within smart contracts structured around the open MUD standard. While state can be entirely fetched from an Ethereum node for the chain that Primodium is deployed on, the state cannot be efficiently queried. For context, in `v0.9.0`, querying the full state of the two-month-long round directly from the node via an RPC endpoint could take upwards of an hour.

Previous versions of Primodium used a hosted [off-chain indexer](https://mud.dev/services/indexer) implemented by Lattice. Since state in Primodium is global across all players instead of round-based, initializing the Primodium client requires fetching the entire state from the off-chain indexer.

The default indexer implementation required a fallback for hydrating the state from RPC; however, state fetched from nodes via RPC cannot be selectively queried, which meant that state had to be fetched in whole by the off-chain indexer on initialization. Past a certain state size, the off-chain indexer container would run out of memory and always fall back to fetching from RPC.

The latest version of Primodium implements this off-chain indexer to address the above issues. Instead of fetching state directly from MUD-compliant contracts, this package suite always assumes the availability of a schemaful Postgres database that contains MUD-compliant state with no RPC fallback.

## Deployment

See the [Github Container Registry](https://github.com/primodiumxyz/mud-state-tools/pkgs/container/pg-indexer-reader) for the latest Docker builds of `@primodiumxyz/pg-indexer-read`.

Additionally, `@primodiumxyz/pg-indexer-read` requires an existing schemaful Postgres database that conforms to the open MUD standard in production. Therefore, this package is best paired with the [`postgres-indexer`](https://mud.dev/services/indexer#schemaful-indexing-with-postgresql-via-npx) in `@latticexyz/store-indexer`, with its latest Docker builds available [here](https://github.com/latticexyz/mud/pkgs/container/store-indexer).

The following is a sample YAML deployment of the above indexer architecture.

```

After deploying a test or production indexer instance, the `@primodiumxyz/sync-stack` package can be used to hydrate and selectively query state from the new indexer. See its corresponding [`README.md`](https://github.com/primodiumxyz/mud-state-tools/blob/main/packages/sync-stack/README.md) for more information.
