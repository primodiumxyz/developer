# Unreal Engine MUD

The **Primodium Unreal Engine MUD Libraries** are a set of three libraries that
allow [Unreal Engine](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US) game clients to
seamlessly interact with Ethereum smart contracts built with the
[MUD](https://mud.dev/introduction) standard.

The libraries are split across three packages:

- [@primodiumxyz/UEMUD](https://github.com/primodiumxyz/UEMUD): MUD Unreal
  Engine client
- [@primodiumxyz/ContextFramework](https://github.com/primodiumxyz/ContextFramework):
  Custom ECS framework for Unreal Engine
- [@primodiumxyz/UEEmojimonExample](https://github.com/primodiumxyz/UEEmojimonExample):
  Example game using the above libraries

## UEMUD

[**UEMUD**](https://github.com/primodiumxyz/UEMUD) is an Unreal Engine plugin
for developing clients for on-chain games built with the MUD framework. It has
the following dependencies:

- [turbolink](https://github.com/thejinchao/turbolink)
- [web3.unreal](https://github.com/G7DAO/web3.unreal)

## ContextFramework

[**CustomFramework**](https://github.com/primodiumxyz/ContextFramework) is a
Custom [ECS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity_component_system) framework
for Unreal Engine. This is a very early work-in-progress (WIP).

### Core

#### Data Types

`FCF_Context`: an Entity in the ECS. Each `FCF_Context` is unique and holds data
as a map of components.

`FCF_Component`: Each component type either holds **mutable** or **immutable**
data for the context where it is stored. Components can also be used as flags
for checking.

#### Functionality

`UCF_Core`: a static function library used to create and remove contexts and set
or remove components from contexts

`UCF_CoreSubsystem`: a game instance subsystem that stores and handles context
and component actions internally. This subsystem is used internally by
`UCF_Core`.

#### Unreal Engine Binding

`ACF_ActorWrapper`: This (and all Wrapper types) can be bound to a context using
the unique ID stored on them. They allow function calls within their hierarchy
to access the bound context without manually using the context ID.

### Events

#### Data Types

`FCF_Message`: The base data type for messages sent through the event system.

#### Functionality

`UCF_EventStatics` is a static function library to listen to messages and send
messages, both locally or over the network.

`UCF_EventSubsystem` is a game instance subsystem that stores listeners for
events, and fires those events on the instance it runs on.

#### ENetworkMessageMode

`FromServerToAllClients`: Broadcasts the message locally on the server, then
fires on all clients through the `GameState`. `FromServerToSepcificClient`:
Broadcasts the message locally on the server, then fires on a specific client
(using `PlayerId`) through their `PlayerState`. `FromClientToServer`: Broadcasts
the message locally on the client, then fires on the server (using the invoker
client's `PlayerState`). The `PlayerState` can also be used for authentication
to allow or disallow the event.

#### Details

`DoubleMessageTypeEvents`: Since we cannot directly template message types for
component types (for general events that might be fired based on another data
type), we use _double message types_ to handle these scenarios. For example, if
you want to listen for an event when `FSampleComponent` is set on any context,
you would use a combination of `FCF_ComponentSetMessageBase` and
`FSampleComponent` to listen for that event.

### Groups

Groups make it easier to query specific contexts that share one or more
component types and to cache that query for later use. They also allow for
“singleton” type access to data in the form of components when the group only
has a single context in it.

#### Data Types

`UCF_GroupStatics`: a static function library used to access group
functionalities such as getting and setting singleton components and retrieve
group contexts

You can also set singleton components using a singleton component type. For
instance, if a context has a specific singleton component type as a flag, the
developer can set components on that context using the flag component type.

##### Example Usage

If we use `FC_SB_IsPlayerContext` to flag contexts that hold player data, we can
retrieve the group of contexts that have this component. The first time a group
is requested, it will search all contexts to build the group. After that, the
group automatically updates whenever this component type is added or removed
from a context, and accessing the group again will not require a new search.

> **Tip**  
> You can create groups earlier by having subsystems that initialize these
> groups, so the initial search is done before gameplay logic needs them.

### Systems

There is no _specific_ type required when writing systems for the Context
Framework, but a recommended approach makes it easier to manage.

In practice, we:

1. Create systems as Unreal Engine Subsystems.
2. Place them in the module where they should be initialized.
3. Inherit them from special subsystem classes made for that submodule (to
   prevent loading on the wrong instances in _Play In Editor_ mode).

The key classes are:

- `US_CO_GameInstanceSubsystem`: for client systems.
- `US_SO_GameInstanceSubsystem`: for server systems.

A system typically:

- Listens for an event when initialized.
- Executes logic when that event is triggered.

When multiple systems want to subscribe to the same event, it is better to
create a `ChainSystem` that subscribes to the event and calls logic on the other
systems in the desired order.

Because those other systems are called by the ChainSystem event, they should not
subscribe directly when they are initialized.

## UEEmojimonExample

[**UEEmojimonExample**](https://github.com/primodiumxyz/UEEmojimonExample) is an
Unreal client implementation of the
[MUD Emojimon](https://mud.dev/guides/emojimon) example project using the
[UEMUD](#uemud) Plugin.

### Dependencies

This project has the following dependencies:

- [ContextFramework](https://github.com/a-najafi/ContextFramework)
- [UEMUD](https://github.com/a-najafi/UEMUD)
- [turbolink](https://github.com/thejinchao/turbolink)
- [web3.unreal](https://github.com/G7DAO/web3.unreal)

### Setup and Configuration

1. **Project Settings**

   - Make sure to check your Project Settings for custom configurations
     regarding:
     - MUD World Settings
     - JSON-RPC (jRPC) server address
     - gRPC server addresses

2. **HyperPlay**

   - Currently, HyperPlay must be installed and running to send transactions.
   - Work is in progress (WIP) for encoding and signing transactions via
     `eth_sendRawTransaction`.

3. **MUD gRPC Services**

   - The client syncs using MUD gRPC services (stream and snapshot), which must
     be running.
   - Set the address and port through the **turbolink** plugin settings.

4. **Faucet Service**

   - To receive test funds (drip), a faucet service must be running.

5. **Generated Classes**

   - The included **turbolink** plugin has generated classes for MUD services,
     which will be refactored into **UEMUD** later.

6. **Modified web3.unreal**
   - `web3Unreal` has been modified to receive `ChainMetadata` in its function.

### Gameplay Notes

- **Join the game**  
  Press **E** to join. The spawn location is currently hard-coded to **(2,2)**.
- **Movement**  
  Use **WASD** or arrow keys to move the avatar.

- **Avatar Colors**
  - Your local avatar is **green**.
  - Other players’ avatars are **white**.
