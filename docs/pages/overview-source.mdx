# Primodium Source

The **Primodium source code** is available across two repositories:

- [`@primodiumxyz/primodium`](https://github.com/primodiumxyz/primodium/): Full
  source code with both Ethereum smart contracts and TypeScript frontend
- [`@primodiumxyz/contracts`](https://github.com/primodiumxyz/contracts): Source
  of generated smart contract interfaces for world extension developers

All Primodium contracts conform to the open [MUD standard](https://mud.dev) for
large-scale Ethereum applications, details of which can be found in the
[Primodium contracts guide](./overview-contracts.mdx) and the
[MUD documentation](https://mud.dev/introduction).

In our development process, we also added supplements to the standard that
improved Primodium's internal design and developer experience. Our commitment to
open source means that these improvements will be shared as development
progresses, such as [Primodium world extensions](./world-extension.mdx) and
[prototype generation](./overview-source/generation.mdx) scripts.

The initial sections describe deploying your own Primodium instance, followed by
World Extension development resources.

## Installation

The [`@primodiumxyz/primodium`](https://github.com/primodiumxyz/primodium/)
monorepo contains the entire stack for running Primodium, including the React
client and Phaser game, the local postgres indexer (that can be deployed to a
cloud provider as well) and all the contracts.

### Prerequisites

There are a few CLI tools to install to be compatible with the entire monorepo.

- [node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) v20.x - Tested with node v20.18.2.
  - You can use [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to install and manage
    multiple versions of node.
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation) v8.x - Tested with pnpm v8.15.9.
- [Foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation) - This will
  get installer during the "prepare" script.
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) - Or any other containerization
  tool.

### Setup

Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/primodiumxyz/primodium.git
```

Install all dependencies:

```bash
pnpm i
```

### Environment

Create a `.env` file in the root of the project, and follow the instructions in
the `.env.example` file to set the environment variables.

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

You will also need to write the deployer's private key in some environment
variable in the contracts package.

```bash
# The default anvil private key
echo "PRIVATE_KEY=0xac0974bec39a17e36ba4a6b4d238ff944bacb478cbed5efcae784d7bf4f2ff80" >> ./packages/contracts/.env
```

### Structure

```ml
examples - "Examples and boilerplate for adding extensions to the game"
packages - "Components of the entire stack for running Primodium"
├── assets - "All ingame assets and atlas"
├── client - "React client that integrates other components and supercharges with a browser UI"
├── contracts - "MUD contracts, configuration and infrastructure—basically the whole state and conditions of the game"
├── core - "Core logic, systems, hooks and utilities for the client"
├── engine - "Game engine for managing Phaser scenes and user inputs"
└── game - "Core Phaser infrastructure for the game; objects, scenes, systems, input controls, etc."
```

## Development

### Running the game

The whole stack can be run with the following command:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

This will run a series of scripts each in a separate window, including the
client, the development chain (on which contracts get deployed) and the local
postgres indexer.

> NOTE: When running the indexer locally, docker network and volumes properly
> clear only on rerun of `pnpm dev:indexer`. If you would like to manually free
> these resources run `pnpm clean:indexer`.

### Building

You can build the entire monorepo with the following command:

```bash
pnpm build
```

This will build the client and core packages, and compile the contracts as well
as generate the ABIs and TypeScript bindings.

### Testing

To run the tests for every package, run the following:

```bash
pnpm test
```

Or if you want to run the tests for a specific package, navigate to that package
directory and run the same command.

## Deployment

To deploy the contracts on a specific chain, follow these steps:

1. Update
   [`.env`](https://github.com/primodiumxyz/primodium/tree/main/.env.example):
   - `PRI_DEV`: set to `"false"` if you don't want to deploy the `DevSystem`
     contract.
   - `PRI_CHAIN_ID`: set to the chain you want to deploy to; you will also need
     to add or update the `[profile.<chain_id>]` field in
     [`packages/contracts/foundry.toml`](https://github.com/primodiumxyz/primodium/tree/main/packages/contracts/foundry.toml).
2. Add the private key of the deployer to
   [`packages/contracts/.env`](https://github.com/primodiumxyz/primodium/tree/main/packages/contracts/.env.example):
   ```bash
   echo "PRIVATE_KEY=<your-private-key>" >> ./packages/contracts/.env
   ```
3. Deploy the contracts:
   ```bash
   pnpm deploy:<chain_id> # if the command doesn't exist, create it in both `packages/contracts/package.json` and `package.json`
   ```

## World Extension Resources

For developers creating world extensions, the following resources are available:

Contract [Tables](./overview-contracts/tables.mdx):

- [`@primodiumxyz/contracts/src/codegen/tables`](https://github.com/primodiumxyz/primodium/blob/main/packages/contracts/src/codegen/tables):
  Generated Solidity contracts for each table.
- [`@primodiumxyz/contracts/mud.config.ts`](https://github.com/primodiumxyz/primodium/blob/main/packages/contracts/mud.config.ts):
  Configuration file that defines each table compliant with the open MUD
  standard.

Contract [Systems](./overview-contracts/systems.mdx):

- [`@primodiumxyz/contracts/src/codegen/world`](https://github.com/primodiumxyz/primodium/blob/main/packages/contracts/src/codegen/world):
  Generated Solidity interfaces for each publicly-accessible system.

Contract
[Prototype Table Data](./overview-contracts/tables.mdx#prototype-tables):

- [`@primodiumxyz/contracts/src/codegen/prototypes/AllPrototype.sol`](https://github.com/primodiumxyz/primodium/blob/main/packages/contracts/src/codegen/prototypes/AllPrototype.sol):
  Data populated in prototype tables that store game configuration data such as
  resource requirements and building costs.

Contract [Prototype Generation Scripts](./overview-source/generation.mdx):

- [`@primodiumxyz/contracts/src/codegen/scripts/CreateTerrain.sol`](https://github.com/primodiumxyz/primodium/blob/main/packages/contracts/src/codegen/scripts/CreateTerrain.sol):
  [Foundry script](https://book.getfoundry.sh/tutorials/solidity-scripting) for
  populating terrain ore distribution.
