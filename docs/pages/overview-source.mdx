# Primodium Source

Primodium contracts will be open-sourced in their entirety once the game design
and balancing are finalized. Before then, the source code for Primodium tables
and interfaces for systems are available, with their role in developing
[world extensions](./world-extension.mdx) described in the following pages.

All Primodium contracts conform to the open [MUD standard](https://mud.dev) for
large-scale Ethereum applications, details of which can be found in the
[Primodium contracts guide](./overview-contracts.mdx) and the
[MUD documentation](https://mud.dev/introduction).

In our development process, we also added supplements to the standard that
improved Primodium's internal design and developer experience. Our commitment to
open source means that these improvements will be shared as development
progresses, such as [Primodium world extensions](./world-extension.mdx) and
[prototype generation](./overview-source/generation.mdx) scripts.

All contract sources are located in the
[`@primodiumxyz/contracts`](https://github.com/primodiumxyz/contracts) package.

## Quickstart

Contract [Tables](./overview-contracts/tables.mdx):

- [`@primodiumxyz/contracts/src/codegen/tables`](https://github.com/primodiumxyz/contracts/blob/main/src/codegen/tables):
  Generated Solidity contracts for each table.
- [`@primodiumxyz/contracts/mud.config.ts`](https://github.com/primodiumxyz/contracts/blob/main/mud.config.ts):
  Configuration file that defines each table compliant with the open MUD
  standard.

Contract [Systems](./overview-contracts/systems.mdx):

- [`@primodiumxyz/contracts/src/codegen/world`](https://github.com/primodiumxyz/contracts/blob/main/src/codegen/world):
  Generated Solidity interfaces for each publicly-accessible system.

Contract
[Prototype Table Data](./overview-contracts/tables.mdx#prototype-tables):

- [`@primodiumxyz/contracts/src/codegen/prototypes/AllPrototype.sol`](https://github.com/primodiumxyz/contracts/blob/main/src/codegen/prototypes/AllPrototype.sol):
  Data populated in prototype tables that store game configuration data such as
  resource requirements and building costs.

Contract [Prototype Generation Scripts](./overview-source/generation.mdx):

- [`@primodiumxyz/contracts/src/codegen/scripts/CreateTerrain.sol`](https://github.com/primodiumxyz/contracts/blob/main/src/codegen/scripts/CreateTerrain.sol):
  [Foundry script](https://book.getfoundry.sh/tutorials/solidity-scripting) for
  populating terrain ore distribution.
