# About Primodium

![screenshot-1](../public/gameplay/orbit.png)

Primodium was founded to push the boundaries of fully on-chain applications.

We have built two fully on-chain games, [Primodium](./quickstart.mdx) and
[Primodium: Empires](./empires), alongside a set of open-source
[libraries](./reactive-tables.mdx) for Ethereum to help developers build their
own [extensions](./world-extension.mdx). We have also built
[infrastructure](./dex-indexer.mdx) to support consumer apps that use data from
Solana decentralized exchanges (DEX) and a demo app named [Tub](./tub.mdx).

This documentation serves as a guide to all work done by the Primodium team.
Refer to the linked repositories from each page for more information on each
specific package.
