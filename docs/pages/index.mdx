## Contract Extensions

Get started as a Primodium developer by cloning the example [**ReadDemo**](./examples/readdemo.mdx) world extension.

```bash showLineNumbers copy
# Clone the Primodium Developer repository:
git clone https://github.com/primodiumxyz/developer.git

# Change your active directory:
cd developer/examples/ReadDemo/packages/contracts

# Install the necessary packages and build the project:
pnpm i && pnpm build

# Test the project:
forge test

# Do a dry-run of deployment:
forge script script/RegisterReadDemoSystem.s.sol --fork-url https://primodium-sepolia.rpc.caldera.xyz/http
```

**World extensions** refer to player smart contracts that extend the functionality of Primodium's core contracts, which are documented in the [world extensions guide](./world-extension.mdx).

## Game Design

You can contribute to Primodium's design and balancing by submitting pull requests to [`@primodiumxyz/contracts/config/prototypeConfig.ts`](https://github.com/primodiumxyz/contracts/blob/main/config/prototypeConfig.ts), which contains the main configuration for game prototypes in Primodium.

For example, the following code block from the above file defines the prototype data for `IronPlateFactory`, a building that produces `IronPlates` from iron mines. There are four fields that you can immediately modify to your own needs:

- `P_RequiredBaseLevel` denotes the base level required to construct or upgrade the building.
- `P_RequiredResources` denotes the resources required to construct or upgrade the building.
- `P_RequiredDependency` denotes the existing production rate required for the building to produce.
- `P_Production` specifies the production resources and denotes its production rate.

```ts filename="@primodiumxyz/contracts/config/prototypeConfig.ts#L510-L560" showLineNumbers {10-17}
{
  // ...
  IronPlateFactory: {
    tables: {
      P_Blueprint: { value: getBlueprint(2, 2) },
      P_MaxLevel: { value: 7n },
    },
    levels: {
      1: {
        // Requires Main Base Level 1 to construct.
        P_RequiredBaseLevel: { value: 1n },
        // `Copper` is required to construct or upgrade.
        P_RequiredResources: getResourceValues({ Copper: 200 }),
        // `IronPlateFactory` requires a minimum `Iron` production rate of `0.2` per second to produce `IronPlates`.
        P_RequiredDependency: getResourceValue({ Iron: 0.2 }),
        // `IronPlates` are produced at a rate of `0.08` per second.
        P_Production: getResourceValues({ IronPlate: 0.08 }),
      },
      // ...
    },
  }
  // ...
}
```

See [`@primodiumxyz/contracts/config/enums.ts`](https://github.com/primodiumxyz/contracts/blob/main/config/enums.ts#L34-L63) for the resource types available in Primodium. The following [prototype config](./overview-source/configuration.mdx) in TypeScript is [generated](./overview-source/generation.mdx) into Solidity on compilation.

```ts filename="@primodiumxyz/contracts/config/enums.ts#L34-L48" showLineNumbers
export enum EResource {
  Iron = 1,
  Copper,
  Lithium,

  Titanium,
  Iridium,
  Kimberlite,
  Platinum,

  IronPlate,
  Alloy,
  PVCell,
  RocketFuel,
  // ...
}
```
