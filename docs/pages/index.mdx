## Contract Extensions

Get started as a Primodium developer by cloning the example [`building-upgrade-bounty`](https://github.com/primodiumxyz/developer/tree/main/examples/building-upgrade-bounty) world extension.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/primodiumxyz/developer
cd developer/examples/building-upgrade-bounty
```

**World extensions** refer to player smart contracts that extend the functionality of Primodium's core contracts, which are documented in the [world extensions guide](./world-extension.mdx).

## Game Design

You can contribute to Primodium's design and balancing by submitting pull requests to [`/contract-source/config/prototypeConfig.ts`](https://github.com/primodiumxyz/developer/blob/main/contract-source/config/prototypeConfig.ts), which contains the main configuration for game prototypes in Primodium.

For example, the following code block from the above file defines the prototype data for `IronPlateFactory`, a building that produces `IronPlates` from iron mines. There are four fields that you can immediately modify to your own needs:

- `P_RequiredBaseLevel` denotes the base level required to construct or upgrade the building.
- `P_RequiredResources` denotes the resources required to construct or upgrade the building.
- `P_RequiredDependency` denotes the existing production rate required for the building to produce.
- `P_Production` specifies the production resources and denotes its production rate.

See [`/contract-source/config/enums.ts`](https://github.com/primodiumxyz/developer/blob/main/contract-source/config/enums.ts#L34) for the resource types available in Primodium.

```ts filename="/contract-source/config/prototypeConfig.ts#L510-L560" showLineNumbers {10-17}
{
  // ...
  IronPlateFactory: {
    tables: {
      P_Blueprint: { value: getBlueprint(2, 2) },
      P_MaxLevel: { value: 7n },
    },
    levels: {
      1: {
        // Requires Main Base Level 1 to construct.
        P_RequiredBaseLevel: { value: 1n },
        // `Copper` is required to construct or upgrade.
        P_RequiredResources: getResourceValues({ Copper: 200 }),
        // `IronPlateFactory` requires a minimum `Iron` production rate of `0.2` per second to produce `IronPlates`.
        P_RequiredDependency: getResourceValue({ Iron: 0.2 }),
        // `IronPlates` are produced at a rate of `0.08` per second.
        P_Production: getResourceValues({ IronPlate: 0.08 }),
      },
      // ...
    },
  }
  // ...
}
```
