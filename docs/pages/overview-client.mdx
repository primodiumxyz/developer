## Introduction

The Primodium client is available in the
[`/packages/client`](https://github.com/primodiumxyz/primodium/tree/main/packages/client)
directory in the
[`@primodiumxyz/primodium`](https://github.com/primodiumxyz/primodium/)
monorepo.

This client imports all necessary packages from the rest of this monorepo to be
able to render the Phaser game, with a React UI on top of it, interact with the
contracts, and sync the state with the indexer database (or RPC updates).

## Running the game

Follow the [README](./overview-source/) in the root of th to install the
necessary dependencies and configure the environment.

```bash
pnpm dev
# or from root, provided that the backend is running
pnpm dev:client
```

Then navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

## Organization

[the core package](https://github.com/primodiumxyz/primodium/tree/main/core) for
all the logic,
[the engine package](https://github.com/primodiumxyz/primodium/tree/main/engine)
for the Phaser scene management (api, creating scenes, rendering chunks),
[the game package](https://github.com/primodiumxyz/primodium/tree/main/game) for
