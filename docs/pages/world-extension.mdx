# Primodium World Extensions

Primodium supports a set of delegation methods for player to create their own
extensions.

**World extension** is a concept introduced by
[MUD](https://mud.dev/guides/extending-a-world) that allows third parties to
extend a core world contract with new commands, logic, and data while still
being subject to the same rules and restrictions (aka on-chain physics) as the
core game. This is different from modding, which can involve changing the rules
and restrictions of the game.

If this is a confusing concept, you can think of World Extension as "Contract
Plugins" to the Primodium world. These extensions occupy an extended namespace
separate from the core namespace, whose systems can interact with Primodium
systems after [delegation](./world-extension/structure/delegation.mdx).
