# Solana DEX Indexer stack

The **Primodium DEX Indexer Stack** is a full stack for indexing DEX trades and
tokens on Solana with high performance and low latency.

This monorepo is composed of two libraries available from npm, as well as
examples and documentation. The libraries are:

- [`@primodiumxyz/dex-indexer`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@primodiumxyz/dex-indexer):
  The indexer for Solana DEX trades and token metadata
- [`@primodiumxyz/dex-graphql`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@primodiumxyz/dex-graphql):
  The GraphQL client and Hasura/Timescale databases management framework

It is also responsible for building and publishing Docker images for both the
indexer and databases to the GitHub Container Registry, that can be used for
running the two packages in production, e.g. inside an AWS ECS instance. You
will find examples on how to use them
[in the resources](https://github.com/primodiumxyz/dex-indexer-stack/blob/main/resources/).

These images are available at:

- [`sdi-indexer`](https://github.com/primodiumxyz/dex-indexer-stack/pkgs/container/sdi-indexer)
  — [example usage](./resources/indexer.docker-compose.yaml)
- [`sdi-hasura-cache`](https://github.com/primodiumxyz/dex-indexer-stack/pkgs/container/sdi-hasura-cache)
  — [example usage](./resources/hasura.docker-compose.yaml)

Example Deployments:

- [`Example dashboard`](./examples/dashboard/README.md)
- [`Example server`](./examples/server/README.md)

## Introduction

The source code this repository is available on Github
[here](https://github.com/primodiumxyz/dex-indexer-stack).

See the dedicated README in each package for detailed documentation.

- [DEX Indexer](./dex-indexer/indexer.mdx)
- [DEX GraphQL](./dex-indexer/graphql.mdx)

### Overview

The
[`DEX Indexer`](https://github.com/primodiumxyz/dex-indexer-stack/blob/main/packages/indexer/README.md)
and
[`DEX GraphQL`](https://github.com/primodiumxyz/dex-indexer-stack/blob/main/packages/gql/README.md)
packages compose the entire stack for indexing trades and tokens, managing the
database in which the data is stored, and querying it through a type-safe
GraphQL API.

The
[`example dashboard`](https://github.com/primodiumxyz/dex-indexer-stack/blob/main/examples/dashboard/README.md)
and
[`example server`](https://github.com/primodiumxyz/dex-indexer-stack/blob/main/examples/server/README.md)
expose the way it is intended to query and interact with the database.

The codebase is structured as a `pnpm` monorepo with the following structure:

```ml
examples - "Example integrations with the indexer stack"
├── dashboard - "A React explorer for top-ranked tokens by 30-min volume, with price and candlestick charts"
└── server - "A Fastify server that exposes endpoints and performs periodic tasks on the database"
packages - "Libraries that compose the indexer stack"
│── indexer - "The indexer for Solana DEX trades and token metadata"
└── gql - "The GraphQL client and Hasura/Timescale databases management framework"
resources - "Examples and resources for running and understanding the stack"
```

### Installation

This monorepo uses `pnpm` as its package manager. First,
[install `node`, then `npm`](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm),
then install `pnpm`.

```bash
npm install -g pnpm
```

This repository is tested with `node` version `23.5.0` and `pnpm` version
`9.15.2`.

Then, clone the repository and install the necessary npm packages with the
following from the root folder:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/primodiumxyz/dex-indexer-stack.git
cd dex-indexer-stack
pnpm i
```

### Environment

To set the current environment variables for both local development and
production, copy `/.env.example` to a new `/.env`.

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

See
[the example environment file](https://github.com/primodiumxyz/dex-indexer-stack/blob/main/.env.example)
for information on each variable.

### Dependencies

This stack—or specifically the indexer—requires some external services to
request and subscribe to onchain data.

- [Yellowstone GRPC](https://github.com/rpcpool/yellowstone-grpc) for streaming
  transactions with low latency
- [Jupiter](https://station.jup.ag/docs/apis/price-api-v2) for fetching token
  prices (`/prices`)
- [DAS API](https://developers.metaplex.com/das-api) for fetching token metadata
  in the Metaplex standard (`/getAssets`)

All of these are available from QuickNode through add-ons, which is the
recommended way to run the indexer.

Otherwise, Hasura and Timescale will be run locally during development, and can
be either self-hosted or cloud-hosted with their respective offerings.

## Development

### Running the stack

First, install
[Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/), or any other
preferred Docker alternative. [OrbStack](https://orbstack.dev/) is a good and
efficient alternative for Mac users.

Running the following in the root directory of this monorepo will spin up both
the indexer and databases/interfaces.

```bash
pnpm dev
```

To run the examples, run the following **as well**:

```bash
pnpm dev:examples
# or just one of the examples
pnpm dev:examples:dashboard
pnpm dev:examples:server
```

### Testing and building

To build both the indexer and GraphQL packages, run the following:

```bash
pnpm build
```

And to test all packages, run the following:

```bash
pnpm test
```
