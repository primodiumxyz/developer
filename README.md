# Primodium Developer Docs and Examples

This monorepo contains documentation source and extension examples for Primodium developers. Visit [here](https://developer.primodium.xyz) for the live developer documentation.

## Directories

NOTE: The example MUD projects in `examples` are meant to be used independently as templates. A `packages` directory will be created for relevant external packages for world extension examples in the future.
